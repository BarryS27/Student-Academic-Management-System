# 🎓 Student Academic Management System (SAMS)

**A comprehensive, Python-based CLI tool designed for high school students to track academic performance, manage portfolios, and visualize progress.**

> **Status:** Active Development  
> **Python Version:** 3.8+

---

## 📖 Overview

SAMS is a personal data management system built with a modular **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** architecture. It moves beyond simple spreadsheets by offering a robust Command Line Interface (CLI) to manage Grades (G9-G12), Self-Development activities, and University applications.

Unlike basic scripts, SAMS includes **data persistence** (CSV), **input validation**, and **advanced data visualization** using Seaborn to analyze academic strengths.

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. 📊 Smart Data Management
- **Flexible Records**: Track grades, weights, and detailed scores (Q1-Q4) for multiple years (G9-G12).
- **Portfolio Tracking**: Manage non-academic data like "Self Development" skills and "Dream Schools".
- **CRUD Operations**: Fully supported **C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate, and **D**elete functionalities.
- **Auto-Save**: All changes are instantly persisted to local CSV files.

### 2. 🎨 Advanced Visualization
- **iOS-Style Analytics**: Integrated `viz.py` module generates aesthetic, "Apple-style" performance charts.
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib**: Uses advanced plotting libraries to visualize course performance based on total points.
- **Clean UI**: Visualizations feature rounded bars, pastel color palettes, and minimal "junk" (despined axes).

### 3. 🖥️ User Experience (UX) Focused
- **Human-Centric UI**: 1-based indexing for all lists (no more mental math converting 0-based indexes).
- **Tabulate Integration**: Data is presented in clean, rounded ASCII tables for high readability.
- **Menu-Driven**: No need to type complex table names; select operations via simple numeric menus.
